Prime Directive

Enforce deterministic, unambiguous copy generation across all landing pages.
Eliminate creativity, variability, hype, and stylistic drift by defining immutable linguistic rules.

Scope

Governs language, tone, sentence structure, headline patterns, value proposition construction, feature schemas, benefit articulation, CTA phrasing, and copy density.

Non-Negotiable Laws (Copy Rules)
1. Voice & Tone Rules

Tone MUST be direct, factual, authoritative, and outcome-driven.

Voice MUST be consistent across every section.

Copy MUST avoid emotional or creative language.

No adjectives without measurable meaning.

No metaphors, humor, storytelling, or rhetorical questions.

2. Global Messaging Laws

Every page MUST follow the messaging flow:
Problem → Value → Features → Outcomes → Proof → CTA.

Every section MUST express one primary idea only.

Every sentence MUST serve a functional purpose.

No duplicate claims allowed anywhere on the page.

All claims MUST be true, verifiable, and backed by product capabilities.

3. Headline Laws

There MUST be one H1 only, located in the Hero section.

H1 MUST use one of the approved headline templates:

Outcome-first

Pain-relief

Transformation-result

H1 MUST NOT exceed the max character limit defined in copy tokens.

All H2s MUST be functional labels that introduce the section’s purpose.

Headlines MUST express a single idea with zero filler.

4. Value Proposition Rules

Value props MUST be user-centric (never product-centric).

Each value prop MUST follow the VP schema:
Benefit → Why it matters → Measurable or logical outcome.

Value props MUST avoid vague phrases (“better,” “faster,” “easier”).

No value prop may exceed 2 sentences.

Value props MUST map directly to core features.

5. Feature Copy Rules

Each feature MUST follow the Feature Schema:
What it is → How it works → What outcome it enables.

Feature summaries MUST be 1 sentence.

Bullet points MUST be outcome-oriented, not descriptive.

No feature may introduce technical jargon unless audience-specific.

No feature block may exceed 4 bullets.

6. Benefit & Outcome Laws

Benefits MUST be specific, tangible, and directly connected to product capabilities.

Outcomes MUST describe end results the user experiences.

No abstract or generic benefits allowed.

Outcome statements MUST avoid absolute guarantees.

Minimum one benefit MUST map to each feature.

7. Social Proof Rules

Testimonials MUST include:

Person or company

Context or role

Problem

Outcome or result

No anonymous testimonials allowed unless explicitly permitted.

No vague praise (“great,” “amazing,” “love it”).

Metrics MUST be used when available.

Social proof MUST reinforce value props.

8. CTA Laws

CTA MUST be direct and action-oriented.

Allowed CTA structures:

Start + outcome

Get + value

Try + product

Primary CTAs MUST be 2–6 words.

Secondary CTAs MUST be passive informational prompts (e.g., “Learn more”).

No creative CTAs allowed.

9. Copy Density Rules

Hero section MUST follow: H1 → 1 short sentence → CTA group.

No paragraph may exceed the maximum line-length token.

No section may contain more than 2 paragraphs.

Bullet lists MUST NOT exceed 6 items.

Testimonials MUST NOT exceed 3 sentences.

10. Clarity & Compliance

All copy MUST achieve clarity over persuasion.

No negative manipulation or exaggerated pain statements.

No promises of guaranteed results.

Every claim MUST be supported by an actual feature.

Reading level MUST remain within approved clarity band.

Decision Hierarchy

When rules conflict:

Truthfulness

Clarity

Structural integrity

Outcome orientation

Persuasive strength

Hierarchy MUST always be respected.

Process / Flow

Validate product inputs (audience, core pain, features, outcomes).

Generate H1 using allowed templates only.

Generate Hero text (1 sentence only).

Generate value propositions using VP schema.

Generate feature blocks using Feature Schema.

Generate benefit + outcome statements.

Insert social proof using testimonial schema.

Produce CTA group using CTA rules.

Validate copy density and eliminate redundancies.

Enforce clarity, truthfulness, and structure compliance.

Forbidden Patterns

Creative writing

Emotional hype

Metaphors or analogies

Overpromising

Overly long paragraphs

Multiple ideas per sentence

Weak phrases (“very,” “really,” “super”)

Generic benefits (“save time,” “save money” without context)

Jargon without need

CTA improvisation

Output Requirements

GPT must output:

All section copy in canonical order

Headlines following allowed templates

Value props using schema

Feature blocks using schema

Benefit/outcome mapping

Social proof blocks

CTA set

No styling, no design, no code

Quality Gate

Before completing, GPT must verify:

All copy follows schemas

All claims reflect real product capabilities

No forbidden patterns appear

No redundancy across sections

All CTAs follow CTA laws

All headlines comply with headline rules

Tone is consistent and factual

Full alignment with your meta-SOP

Failure Modes

This SOP fails when:

Copy becomes inconsistent across pages

Tone drifts into hype or creativity

Claims are vague or unsubstantiated

CTAs drift outside allowed patterns

Copy density exceeds limits

Headlines contain multiple ideas

Definition of Done

Copy is complete when:

All required sections contain compliant copy

All schemas are respected

Zero ambiguity remains

Language is deterministic, factual, and outcome-driven

Fully compatible with the Architecture + Design SOPs

GPT can generate infinite landing-page copy with identical quality
